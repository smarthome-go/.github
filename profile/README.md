# Smarthome

## What is Smarthome?
Smarthome is a completely self-build home-automation system written in Go *(backend)* and Svelte *(frontend)*.
The system focuses on functionality and simplicity in order to guarantee a stable and reliable home-automation system, which is actually helpful in automating common tasks.

### Concepts
- Completely self-hostable on your own infrastructure
- Simple setup: when server version `1.0` is released, the entire configuration will be manageable from the web interface
- Is able to operate without internet connection (except for the weather which relies on an API service)
- Privacy focused: Your data will stay on your system because Smarthome is not relying on cloud infrastructure
- An up-to-date docker-image is built and published to Docker Hub on every release 

## Hardware
As of April 27, 2022 the only way to make Smarthome interact with the real world is through the use of [node](https://github.com/smarthome-go/node), a Hardware interface which is required in order to interact with most generic 433mhz remote-sockets.
Naturally, the use of smarthome-hw requires physical hardware in order to communicate with remote sockets.
